SPOTIFY CASE

**insert documentation here** 


*To-Dos*

Preparation: 
Leave one Out instead of train test split \n
separate read-in and split \n
add Error metric for new users \n

Recommendation: 
Check if the raw version works as well, when columns are numeric types. -> Maybe Pyspark converts it?
